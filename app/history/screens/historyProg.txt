to display only one symptom for easier viewing

Sleep: line chart representing hrs of total sleep (over week, month, year), separate line charts to filter for nighttime sleep & naps-- also thinking about how to represent 
with stacked bar graph (where bottom would be regular sleep, top would be nap), but this would only really work in week.... or monthly view at MOST
    - sleep1: WIP
    - sleep2: to be started

Fitness tracking: line charts representing calories burned from exercising, time spent exercising, steps taken (over week, month, year) & for each exercise, bar graph
